Converts addresses in the "<address></address>" tags into links that open a Google Map in a new window. 

== Description ==

This simple plugin converts addresses in "<address></address>" tags into links that open a Google Map in a new window.

NOTE: You need to put the address inside the <address></address> html tag for this plugin to work.  For example, you would need to write the following into your code: <address>112 1/2 Beacon Street, Boston 02108</address>

FYI: This plugin is great for themes with custom fields that supply the address, but is probably not too useful for themes that don't.

== Installation ==

   2. Activate the plugin
