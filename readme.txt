Converts addresses in the "&lt;address&gt;&lt;/address&gt;" tags into links that open a Google Map in a new window.

== Description ==

This simple plugin converts addresses in "`<address></address>`" tags into links that open a Google Map in a new window.

NOTE: You need to put the address inside the `<address></address>` html tag for this plugin to work. For example, you would need to write the following into your code: `<address>112 1/2 Beacon Street, Boston 02108</address>`

FYI: This plugin is great for themes with custom fields that supply the address, but is probably not too useful for themes that don't.  Thanks!

Finally, many many thanks to [Mike Jasper](http://www.mikedoesweb.com/) , who wrote the javascript that powers this plugin.  I merely repackaged his code.
