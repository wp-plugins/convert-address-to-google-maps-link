Converts addresses in the "&lt;address&gt;&lt;/address&gt;" tags into links that open a Google Map in a new window.

== Description ==

This simple plugin converts addresses in "&lt;address&gt;&lt;/address&gt;" tags into links that open a Google Map in a new window.

NOTE: You need to put the address inside the &lt;address&gt;&lt;/address&gt; html tag for this plugin to work. For example, you would need to write the following into your code: &lt;address&gt;112 1/2 Beacon Street, Boston 02108&lt;/address&gt;

FYI: This plugin is great for themes with custom fields that supply the address, but is probably not too useful for themes that don't.  Thanks!

== Installation ==

   1. Unzip and upload the php file to your wordpress plugin directory
   2. Activate the plugin
